This repository is an archive of my CPAN releases, organized by year under
`published/`.

I add automatically to this archive whenever I do a release.

Aside from archival purposes, this repository is also a temporary placeholder
for produced releases that haven't been uploaded to CPAN (e.g. when I work
offline). I place them under `pending/`.

See also `darkpan-cpan` for another archive of CPAN releases in the layout of a
CPAN-like directory, to facilitate easy installation using CPAN client like
cpanm.
